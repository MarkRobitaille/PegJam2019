PhaseDodger is a little arcade game where you dodge colored blocks by phasing your ship's color to match them. Enemy aliens wheel in from the top of the screen to keep you on your toes. Fly for as long as you can and try to reach a high score!

Made in less than 48 hours for Peg Jam 2019 with the theme "Parallel Worlds". The game was developed using Processing and an audio library for Processing called Minim. You can check out all the other games submitted for Peg Jam 2019 on the [game jam's page](https://itch.io/jam/winnipeg-game-jam-2019).

## How Do I Play The Game?  

There are two ways to download and play the game. The first method is the most convenient way to get it up and running fast if you have Windows as your operating system. However, due to Processing's exports sometimes not working on certain computers, there is a second more cumbersome method if you want to play (or if you use Mac/OS).

### Method 1: Easier Option (Windows Only)

1. Go to the [game's itch.io page](https://nightshade.itch.io/phasedodger).  
2. Download the game's zip file.  
3. Extract the zip file and run "PhaseDodger.exe".  

### Method 2: The Alternative  

#### Download Phase Dodger

First off, I'd recommend downloading the game itself from this GitHub repository.

1. Go to the [Phase Dodger repository's main page](https://github.com/MarkRobitaille/PhaseDodger) (note: You're likely already here)
2. Hover over "Clone or download" and click download.

3. Extract the zip file containing the game's files.

#### Download Processing  

Now you'll need to get Processing to run the game in.

4. Go to the [Processing web site](https://processing.org/download/).  
5. Click on the download link for the appropriate operating system.  
6. Extract the zip file containing Processing's executable. 

#### Open Processing and Phase Dodger

With processing and the game downloaded, open them up! Don't hit that run button just yet though...

7. Start the Processing program.
    * Note: For Windows users, this will be the "processing.exe" file. For other operating systems, this will likely be different.  
8. Open Phase Dodger's main file by going to File -> Open and selecting PhaseDodger.pde from the downloaded game files in steps 1-3.  

#### Install Minim

The last thing we need to do is get the audio library Minim, which is what powers the music and sound effects. This is the most painful step for those unfamiliar with Processing but should be pretty quick (only a minute or two).

9. Click "Sketch" -> "Import Library" -> "Add Library..." on the top menu of Processing to open the "Contribution Manager".

10. Search for Minim by typing into the "Filter" input field at the top left.

11. Click on the result for Minim that was created by Damien Di Fide and Anderson Mills.  
12. Click the "Install" button in the bottom section of the window.

13. Close the Contribution Manager window.  
14. Click the run button (the button on the top left with the play button) to start the game.

Now you're finally able to play the game. :)
