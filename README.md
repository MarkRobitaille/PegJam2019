PhaseDodger is a little arcade game where you dodge colored blocks by phasing your ship's color to match them. Enemy aliens wheel in from the top of the screen to keep you on your toes. Fly for as long as you can and try to reach a high score!

Made in less than 48 hours for Peg Jam 2019 with the theme "Parallel Worlds". The game was developed using Processing and an audio library for Processing called Minim. You can check out all the other games submitted for Peg Jam 2019 on the [game jam's page](https://itch.io/jam/winnipeg-game-jam-2019).

### How do I play the game?  

There are two ways to download and play the game. The first method is the most convenient way to get it up and running fast if you have Windows as your operating system. However, due to Processing's exports sometimes not working on certain computers, there is a second more cumbersome method if you want to play (or if you use Mac/OS).

#### Method 1: Easier option (Windows only)

1. Go to the [game's itch.io page](https://nightshade.itch.io/phasedodger).  
2. Download the game's zip file.  
3. Extract the zip file and run "PhaseDodger.exe".  

#### Method 2: The alternative  

##### Download Phase Dodger

1. Go to the [Phase Dodger repository's main page](https://github.com/MarkRobitaille/PhaseDodger) (note: You're likely already here)
2. Hover over "Clone or download" and click download.
3. Extract the zip file containing the game's files.

##### Download Processing  


4. Go to the [Processing web site](https://processing.org/download/).  
5. Click on the download link for the appropriate operating system.  
6. Extract the zip file containing Processing's executable. 

##### Open Processing and Phase Dodger

7. Start the Processing program.  
  * Note: For Windows users, this will be the "rocessing.exe" file. For other operating systems, this will likely be different.  
8. Open Phase Dodger's main file by going to File -> Open and selecting PhaseDodger.pde from the previously downloaded game files in step 1.  

##### Install Minim

9. Click "Sketch" -> "Import Library" -> "Add Library..." on the top menu of Processing to open the "Contribution Manager".

11. Click on the result for Minum that was created by Damien Di Fide and Anderson Mills.  
12. Click the "Install" button in the bottom section of the window.  
13. Close the Contribution Manager window.
